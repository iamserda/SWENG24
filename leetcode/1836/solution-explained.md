# [1836. Remove Duplicates From an Unsorted Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/description/)


## Intuition
Confronted with the challenge of removing duplicate nodes from an unsorted linked list, the instinctive approach is to track occurrences of each value as the list is traversed. The goal is to retain only nodes with unique values while ensuring the original order of these unique nodes is preserved.

## Approach
The provided solution employs a two-pass strategy using a hash table to count occurrences of each node's value:
- **First Pass**: Traverse the list once to populate a hash table (`hash_counter`) with the count of each value.
- **Second Pass**: Traverse the list again, this time removing nodes whose values appear more than once in the hash table.
- A dummy node (`node` with value 0) is utilized at the beginning to simplify edge case handling, particularly when the head of the list needs to be removed.
- The `pre` pointer is used to keep track of the last node in the list that is guaranteed to be kept, facilitating the removal of nodes directly by adjusting `pre.next`.

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: $$O(N)$$ - The list is traversed twice, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the list. The first traversal is for counting occurrences, and the second is for removing duplicates, each taking linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: $$O(N)$$ - The hash table `hash_counter` stores a count for each unique value in the list, which in the worst case (all unique values) requires space proportional to the number of nodes in the list.

## Code
The implementation details are encapsulated within two primary functions:
- `deleteDuplicatesUnsorted` for removing duplicate nodes based on the described approach.
- `linkedlist_to_arr` for converting the linked list back to an array for easy testing and verification of results.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(head: Node) -> Node:
    # Implementation omitted for brevity

def linkedlist_to_arr(head: Node) -> list:
    # Implementation omitted for brevity
```

## Testing
The solution is verified with two test cases, demonstrating its ability to handle both the presence and absence of duplicates:
- **Test 0**: Successfully removes duplicates `[3, 2]` from the list, leaving `[4, 5]`.
- **Test 1**: With no duplicates, the list remains unchanged `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 0]`.
- **Note on Test 2**: This test appears to misunderstand the expected output, merely converting a list to an array without applying `deleteDuplicatesUnsorted`. However, the inclusion and description suggest an oversight rather than a test of functionality.
